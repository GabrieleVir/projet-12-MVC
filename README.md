# Welcome in a MVC project!


For this project, I had to perform an interview and create a website using Model Views Controller design pattern to present his answers.

We had some source at our disposal for the realisation of this project:

* [Templates html/css](https://html5up.net/)
* [Slides for a fast introduction to MVC](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/blob/master/Projects/12-MVC/MVC.pdf)
* [And the briefing](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/tree/master/Projects/12-MVC)

## Difficulties :

And I gathered some more source to help me understand how it works: 

* [Videos on MVC(French)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhVY6ofLym8&index=21&list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16)
* [Grafikart Videos on OOP(French)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16)
* [Sitepoint MVC basics (French)](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-mvc-pattern-and-php-1/)
* [Videos on MVC simplified(English)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpbUqJcch0Y)

I wrote here everyday difficulties I encountered and how I got over it:
* Day 1: I didn't know where to start, I lost a lot of time and energy trying to understand how everything should work but I was looking at the task as a whole. I found a solution after dividing the task in a lot of little subtasks. Focusing on solving the little problems to solve the big one later was the key I needed to finish the first part of this exercise.
 
* Day 2: Starting to break up the index in different view pages and using htaccess and routes to include the views into the index. Was having big trouble linking the css and the javascript. I finally found the problem after testing the differents parts (controller, routes, includes and htaccess), the htaccess file was blocking the css links. For the next days, I'll put the content in the website and create the different pages. (Need two more days of work)

* Day 3: I didn't really have a lot of difficulties. It just took a lot of time to link every views pages correctly with a nav bar that went frome one to another. The last part was to put content in the different pages. I finished the beta today but I still need to clean the code and put it online. Not urgent but it will still take 2 to 3 hours to polish everything.

### To do list to polish this project :
*  ~~Clean the code to apply DRY (*bad dum tsss*)~~ (Done!)
* Put the project online (Will use webhost)
*  ~~Check if the responsive works well.~~ (It works!)
* ~~Normalize the casing of file names [Issue here](https://github.com/GabrieleVir/projet-12-MVC/issues/3#issue-258755698)~~ (Done!)
