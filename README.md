# projet-12-MVC

For this project, I have to perform an interview and create a website using Model Views Controller structure for presenting their answers.
In this case the interviewees are 2 guys: 
* One who had a lot of experiences, done some IoT and backend.
* The other who did an internship in web-development in August.

We have some source at our disposal for the realisation of this project:

* [Templates html/css](https://html5up.net/)
* [Slides for a fast introduction to MVC](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/blob/master/Projects/12-MVC/MVC.pdf)
* [And the briefing](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/tree/master/Projects/12-MVC)

And I have used some more source to help me understand how it works: (Those are french tutorials)

* [Vidéo sur le MVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhVY6ofLym8&index=21&list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16)
* [Sa playlist sur l'orienté objet en php](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16)
* [Basics of MVC tutorial on sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-mvc-pattern-and-php-1/)

I'll write everyday the difficulties I encountered and how I got over it:
* Day 1: I didn't know where to start, I lost a lot of time and energy trying to understand how everything should work but I was looking at the task as a whole. I found a solution after dividing the task in a lot of little subtasks. Focusing on solving the little problems to solve the big one later was the key I needed to finish the first part of this exercise.
 
* Day 2: Starting to break up the index in different view pages and using htaccess and routes to include the views into the index. Was having big trouble linking the css and the javascript. I finally found the problem after testing the differents parts (controller, routes, includes and htaccess), the htaccess file was blocking the css links. For the next days, I'll put the content in the website and create the different pages. (Need two more days of work)

* Day 3: I didn't really have a lot of difficulties. It just took a lot of time to link every views pages correctly with a nav bar that went frome one to another. The last part was to put content in the different pages. I finished the beta today but I still need to clean the code and put it online. Not urgent but it will still take 2 to 3 hours to polish everything.
