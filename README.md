# projet-12-MVC

For this project, I have to perform an interview and create a website using Model Views Controller structure for presenting their answers.
In this case the interviewees are 2 guys: 
* One who had a lot of experiences, done some IoT and backend.
* The other who did an internship in web-development in August.

We have some source at our disposal for the realisation of this project:

* [Templates html/css](https://html5up.net/)
* [Slides for a fast introduction to MVC](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/blob/master/Projects/12-MVC/MVC.pdf)
* [And the briefing](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/tree/master/Projects/12-MVC)

And I have used some more source to help me understand how it works: (Those are french tutorials)

* [Vidéo sur le MVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhVY6ofLym8&index=21&list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16)
* [Sa playlist sur l'orienté objet en php](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16)

Focusing on solving the little problems to solve the big one later was the key I needed to finish the first part of this exercise.
* Day 2:
